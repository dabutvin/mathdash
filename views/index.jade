                    br
                p Players of any age can enjoy MathDash, while elementary-age children can use it to reinforce basic math concepts.  MathDash is unlike most educational games because math is integrated into the core gameplay design.  Unlike traditional tests, you're given an operator and an answer and must solve for the operands.  Do this while chaining combos, activating power-ups, avoiding hazards and competing with your friends and your high score might end up here.

                    p We are a small start-up company that makes video games. We are 3 developers from Drexel University (Philadelphia, PA) who love to make video games. MathDash started as a college project, but quickly became so much more. After winning "Game Design for Phone" in the 2012 Imagine Cup on the national and international level, we took a short break before refining MathDash for release to the public.
